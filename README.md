## General Information
- First iteration of portfolio project for KWS: Katie's Web Services. Designed and deployed as part of the Codecademy full-stack engineer course.
- This site is a work in progress. As my studying/ knowledge progresses, I will continue to update the site in terms of functionality and information on case studies displayed.
- Long-term this will be self-hosted and act as the main point of contact for my freelance work.
## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Javascript
## Features
- Modal boxes for case studies
## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_ 
Will continuously be updated to represent my current status and projects worked on.
## Room for Improvement
Room for improvement:
- Javascript currently clunky 
- Modal box overlay jumps when opened, needs a smoother transition
## Acknowledgements
Many thanks to the Codecademy team for providing the basework and inspiration for this project.
